I made this mod because of this discussion [Spidertron AI tech requirement](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Krastorio2/discussion/5f55307c626fabb7556bf9b3).

Fixes the issue that with Krastorio 2 and Space Exploration installed the technology to unlock the Spidertron is gated behind the AI core technology, without even requiring an AI Core in the recipe. 
This unintentionally causes the Spidertron to be moved to the very end game.

In addition, some changes  from Space Exploration to the ingredients  and prerequisites of the Spidertron technology get overwritten by Krastorio 2. This mod fixes these too.
Thank you TE for bringing it to my attention.

This will probably be fixed at some point by the Space Exploration team. Until then, enjoy!

Does nothing without Krastorio 2 AND Space Exploration installed.
